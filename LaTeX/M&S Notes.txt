You may include: 
- a definition of AuDHD (/)

- a discussion of their current challenges
- why self-sufficiency is particularly important
- why achieving a good quality of life is difficult even with human support systems

- and why you are approaching this problem through technology. (/)

You should also specify which type of technology you are aiming to explore. Without a this, your stated values may remain superficial. -




Method

Your choice of the REDI method seem reasonable, but this section needs more detail. 

You should explain what questions you asked yourself and others, (/)
why these questions were chosen. (/)

Describe how participants were recruited (/)
and how safeguarding done, 
given the possibility of sensitive/personal disclosures. (/)



Results, Analysis and Reflection

The results section discusses the identified values in sufficient depth, particularly your effort to understand participants’ remarks within their individual contexts (e.g., care context, roles). (/)

The discussion of value tensions is generally sound. (/)

A minor suggestion is to align the analysis and interpretation more with your research topic and to refine how the values are framed.


Communication

Report could be improved with a clearer and explicit conclusion, showing how your findings answer your research question. 
The negative value scenario would also benefit from further explanation and clearer articulation.
